## 3. Gameplay Instructions
1. **Character Control**  
   - Use **WSAD** to move.  
   - Use **Shift** to sprint and **Spacebar** to jump.

2. **Photo Mode**  
   - Press **O** to enter Photo Mode.  
   - In Photo Mode, press **V** to capture a photo and save the screenshot.  
   - After taking the photo, press **C** to analyze the animal elements in the image.

3. **Real-Time Analysis Mode**  
   - Press **P** in Normal Mode to enter Real-Time Analysis Mode, dynamically analyzing objects in the surroundings.

## 4. Game Features
1. **Multi-Level YOLO Optimization**  
   - Different YOLO models are used for Photo Mode and Real-Time Analysis Mode. Photo Mode prioritizes accuracy, while Real-Time Mode optimizes speed.

2. **Custom Dataset Fine-Tuning**  
   - A dataset of 700 images covering 7 animal categories was created and fine-tuned to improve the model's performance.

3. **Advantages of AI Technology**  
   - AI-powered object detection enhances interactivity and immersion, offering players a dynamic and diverse gaming experience.
